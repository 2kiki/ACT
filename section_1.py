# ** START. Enter name of character. **
'''
Enter player name. I wrote a function which inputs the name and returns
a dictionary.
'''

# ** Generate attributes. **
'''
This is tricky. I made a function which returned a list of summed dice
rolls. eg [12, 6, 18, 10]. As per instructions.
'''

# ** Assign attributes. **
'''
This is also tricky. I 'popped' items from the above list and added
their value to the corresponding dictionary attribute.

'''

# ** Print character. **
'''
Wrote another function which nicely prints the player dictionary, as per instructions.
